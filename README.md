# Anonymous Voting System using Circom

## 🗳️ Project Overview
This project implements an anonymous voting system leveraging Zero Knowledge Proof technology with Circom.
It explores the implementation of a private and verifiable vote selection mechanism using Circom. This is a key component for building privacy-preserving voting protocols. 
A voter can commit to a single candidate selection without revealing their choice, ensuring the integrity and validity of their vote.
